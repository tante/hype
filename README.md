# hype

This Mastodon bot transfers the trends from other instances directly to your personal timeline. You decide which instances it fetches and how much you want to see per instance. (Forked from Valentin Reiss' [https://github.com/v411e/hype](https://github.com/v411e/hype))

## Why

For smaller instances the local timeline is rather empty. This is why trends simply do not work on those instances: There is just not enough activity. Instead of manually checking out other instances this bot allows to subscribe to a multitude of different mastodon compatible servers to fetch trending posts and repost them to your current server helping discoverability of accounts, people and topics within the federated social web.

## Installation

Deploy with docker-compose

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  hype:
    image: t4nte/hype:latest
    volumes:
      - ./config:/app/config
```

## Configuration

Create a `config.yaml` and a `auth.yaml` file in `./config/`. Enter the credentials of your bot-account into `auth.yaml`. You can define which servers to follow and how often to fetch new posts as well as how to automatically change your profile in config.yaml. See the examples below:

`auth.yaml`:

```yaml
# Credentials for your bot account
bot_account:
  server: "mastodon.example.com"
  email: "hypebot@example.com"
  password: "averylongandsecurepassword"
```

`config.yaml`

```yaml
# Refresh interval in minutes
interval: 60

# Text to add to the bot profile befor the list of subscribed servers
profile_prefix: "I am boosting trending posts from:"

# profile fields to fill in
fields:
  code: https://github.com/tante/hype
  operator: "YOUR HANDLE HERE"

# Define subscribed instances and
# their individual limit (top n trending posts)
# which is again limited by the API to max 20
subscribed_instances:
  chaos.social:
    limit: 20
  mastodon.social:
    limit: 5
```

## Features

- Boost trending posts from other Mastodon instances
- Update bot profile with list of subscribed instances
